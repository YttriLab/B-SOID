	abstract = {Capturing the performance of naturalistic behaviors remains a prohibitively difficult objective. Recent machine learning applications have enabled localization of limb position; however, position alone does not yield behavior. To provide a bridge from positions to actions and their kinematics, we developed Behavioral Segmentation of Open-field in DeepLabCut (B-SOiD). This unsupervised learning algorithm discovers natural patterns in position and extracts their inherent statistics. The cluster statistics are then used to train a machine learning algorithm to classify behaviors with greater speed and accuracy due to improved ability to generalize from subject to subject. Through the application of a novel fram-eshift paradigm, B-SOiD provides the fast temporal resolution required for comparison with neural activity. B-SOiD also provides high-resolution behavioral measures such as stride and grooming kinematics, that are difficult but critical to obtain, particularly in the study of pain, compulsion, and other neurological disorders. This open-source platform surpasses the current state of the field in its improved analytical accessibility, objectivity, and ease of use.},
